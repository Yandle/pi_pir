# Raspberry Pi PIR 

Monitor a PIR sensor for motion during a set time of day and play a sound at your target - if motion persists then send an alert via Google Hangouts.


### DISCLAIMER
The way I code python involves bubble gum, shoe string, and a pinch of Google. I know my code sucks, but it works. The people I freaked out in my office can attest to that
